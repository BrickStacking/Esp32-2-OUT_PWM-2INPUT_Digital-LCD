# Esp32-2-OUT_PWM-2INPUT_Digital-LCD

That's project I use Esp32 cause it have many GPIO, so I can easy to setup the application. I use board to out 2 PWM (control the DC motor), you can add PID algorithm for more stable and accurate control. 2 input for control the heat (DS18B20) and one LCD to display the value.
